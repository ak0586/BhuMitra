BHUMITRA APP USER GUIDE
=======================

Welcome to BhuMitra! Follow this step-by-step guide to use the app effectively.

1. LOGIN / REGISTER SCREEN
--------------------------
- When you first open the app, you must Register (create a new account) or Login.
- You can use your Email and Password or use the Google Sign-In button for quick access.
- Once successfully logged in, you will be navigated to the "Home Screen".

2. HOME SCREEN (Dashboard)
------------------------
This is the main dashboard that appears after login. It contains three main sections:

- **Start Measuring Card:** This is the main card at the top. Click the **"Measure Now"** button here to open the Map and start a new land measurement.

- **Quick Actions Section:**
  - **Saved Plots:** Opens a list of all your previously saved land measurements. You can view details, delete old records, or share them from here.
  - **Unit Converter:** A tool to quickly convert values between different land units (e.g., convert 5 Acres to Bigha) without using the map.
  - **Help:** Opens this User Guide.

3. BOUNDARY MARKING SCREEN (The Map)
------------------------------------
When you click **"Measure Now"**, you reach this screen to mark boundaries.

**Screen Controls:**
- **The Map:** Shows your current location or the area you are viewing.
- **Search Bar (Top):** Type a village, city, or area name here to quickly jump to that location on the map.
- **Map Type Button:** Select between "Normal" (Road) view and "Satellite" view to see actual ground details.
- **Current Location Button:** Instantly re-centers the map to where you are standing right now.
- **Calculate Button (Bottom):** Appears after you mark points. Press this to finalize your measurement.

**How to Measure:**
- **Place Points:** Tap carefully on the map at the corners of the field. Each tap places a "Marker".
- **Undo/Redo:** If you place a point incorrectly, use the Undo icon to remove it.
- **Reset:** Clears all points if you want to start over completely.

⚠️ CRITICAL WARNING: HOW TO MARK BOUNDARIES
-------------------------------------------
(What to do and What NOT to do)

It is crucial to mark the points in the correct order to get an accurate area.

✅ DO THIS (Correct Way):
   - Mark the points in a *SEQUENCE* (Circle-wise).
   - Start at one corner, then go to the immediate next corner along the boundary line (A -> B -> C -> D).
   - *Result:* This forms a clean, closed shape (Polygon).

❌ DO NOT DO THIS (Wrong Way):
   - **Do NOT mark diagonally** (Criss-Cross).
   - Example: Do not mark Top-Left corner, then jump to Bottom-Right corner.
   - *Why?* This causes the boundary lines to INTERSECT (cut each other), creating a "bow-tie" or "hourglass" shape. The app cannot calculate the area of self-intersecting shapes correctly.

Once you have formed a proper closed shape, click the **"Calculate"** button.

4. AREA RESULT SCREEN
---------------------
This screen displays the final measurement details.

- **Total Area Cards:** You will see the total calculated area displayed in multiple standard units:
  - Square Feet
  - Square Meter
  - Square Yard
  - Acre
  - Hectare
- **Share Button:** Click this to share the text summary of your measurement with others (via WhatsApp, SMS, etc.).
- **Save Plot Icon:** Click this to save this measurement into your records history.

ℹ️ CUSTOM UNIT CALCULATION & BASE UNIT
--------------------------------------
At the bottom of the result screen, you will see the "Custom Unit" section. This is for converting the area into local units (like Bigha, Guntha, Kanal).

**How to use it correctly:**
1. Look at the **Total Area** displayed above.
2. Identify the **Base Unit**. The values shown in the specific cards (e.g., the value below "Area Calculated Successfully" in **Square Meter** or other unit) represent your Base Unit.
3. In the Custom Unit section, ensure the **Dropdown Menu** is set to the *same unit* you are looking at.
   - Example: If you are converting the 'Square Meter' value, set the Dropdown to 'Square Meter'.
   - Example: If you are converting the 'Square Feet' value, set the Dropdown to 'Square Feet'.
4. Enter your local unit value (e.g., 1 Bigha = X Sq Meter).
5. Press Calculate to get the result in your custom unit.

*Mistake to Avoid:* Do not leave the base unit and custom unit dropdown as 'Square Feet' if you are entering a 'Square Meter' value. The units must match!
